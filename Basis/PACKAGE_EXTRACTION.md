# Basis Package Extraction — Working Tracker

Working doc for the `working-on-packing` branch. Goal: lift **non-core** packages out of
the Basis monorepo into their own repos on the BasisVR GitHub, list them on
`basisvr.org/packages/`, and make them installable via the Basis Package Manager.
Remove this file before merging to main.

## Conventions (locked)

- **Repo naming:** friendly PascalCase (e.g. `BasisSnapControls`, `BasisAvatarRecorder`),
  matching existing `BasisExamples` / `BasisGizmos` / `BasisVisualTrackers`.
- **History:** preserved per package via **git-filter-repo** on a throwaway hardlinked
  `--no-checkout` clone: `python git-filter-repo --force --subdirectory-filter Basis/Packages/<id>`.
  (Built-in `git subtree split` is far too slow on the ~5700-commit history.) filter-repo isn't
  installed system-wide — the single script sits in the session scratchpad.
- **Disposition (case-by-case):** `opt-in` = removed from the app; users add it via the Package
  Manager. `keep` = still shipped; the monorepo references the new repo as a UPM git dependency.
- **Publish-first, batch removals:** *publishing* a package (repo → seed → generator → website)
  needs no Unity and its localization travels with it, so publish freely. The monorepo *removal*
  of a **localization-bearing** package needs a Unity pass to regenerate
  `Assets/AddressableAssetsData/AssetGroups/Basis Localization.asset`, so collect those removals
  into one Unity session. Packages with no `Localization/Languages/` (e.g. snapcontrols) can be
  removed immediately without Unity.
- **Publishing flow:** edit `src/BasisPM.Server/seed/packages.json` in the Package Manager repo
  (source of truth) → `dotnet run --project src/BasisPM.Server -- generate <out>` (needs .NET 9;
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` for stats) → copy `packages.json`/`catalog.json`/`index.html` into the website's
  `packages/`. Repo root is `Github/Basis`; packages live at `Basis/Packages/<id>`.

## Pipeline

```
new repo (BasisVR/BasisX)  ──►  seed/packages.json  ──(generator)──►  basisvr.org/packages/  ──►  BasisPM install
   package.json at root         (source of truth)     catalog.json      cards + catalog          writes UPM git URL
```

## Removal surface (when a package leaves the monorepo)

Delete the package folder, then trim its entries from:
- `Basis/Packages/packages-lock.json` — the embedded lock block
- `Basis/Assets/Basis/link.xml` — its `<assembly .../>` preserve line (a `keep` package stays here)
- `Basis/Packages/com.basis.framework.editor/Editor/Documentation Engine/BasisDocGenerator.cs` — its `PackageIdsToScan[]` entry
- **If it has `Localization/Languages/`:** `Basis/Assets/AddressableAssetsData/AssetGroups/Basis Localization.asset`
  holds auto-generated `Languages/<pkgid>/<lang>` entries. Unity's Addressables postprocessor prunes
  them on next open — **do a Unity pass; don't hand-edit the group asset.**

**Framework-coupled / third-party (do not extract without refactoring):** sdk, common, server(+nested),
eventdriver, gizmos, bundlemanagement, settings, profilerintergration, openlipsync, textmeshpro, and the
vendored libs hard-referenced by `Basis Framework.asmdef` (jigglephysics, opussharp, urpvolumetricfog,
rnnoise, steamaudio, embedded URP). Several vendored libs already have BasisVR repos (UnityJigglePhysics,
OpusSharp, RNNoise.Net, steam-audio, audiolink) — those are "update existing" jobs, later.

**Cleanup freebies:** ✅ done 2026-07-07 — removed empty `Packages/org.basisvr.zstdsharp/`, empty
`Packages/com.basis.profilerintegration/` (misspelled dup; kept the active `...intergration`), the
`Packages/Basis Server Export/` build artifact, the 19 MB dead `com.valvesoftware.unity.openvr-1.2.1.tgz`,
and the 5 `org.basisvr.*` `.tgz` tarballs (see the 2026-07-07 session below).

## Deferred monorepo changes (batch into one Unity pass)

Removals (regenerate `Basis Localization.asset` — localized):
- com.basis.developer.recorder (BasisAvatarRecorder) — published 2026-07-05
- com.basis.developer.exceptions (BasisExceptionReporting) — published 2026-07-05
- com.basis.provider.servers (BasisServersProvider) — published 2026-07-05

Keep-swaps (add git dep to `Packages/manifest.json` + remove embedded folder; Unity-verify resolve+build):
- com.basis.vehicles (BasisVehicles) — published 2026-07-05 · no localization
- com.basis.examples (BasisExamples) — published 2026-07-05 · no localization (stale repo overwritten)

## Per-package checklist (repeatable)

1. Hardlinked clone: `git clone --no-checkout <monorepo> <scratch>/<Repo>-extract`
2. `python <scratch>/git-filter-repo --force --subdirectory-filter Basis/Packages/<id>` ; `git branch -M main`
3. Add `README.md` (+`.meta`), `LICENSE` (+`.meta`, if missing), `.gitignore`; commit (unsigned)
4. `gh repo create BasisVR/<Repo> --public --description "..." --source <clone> --remote origin --push`
5. Seed entry → run generator → copy JSON (+`index.html` if changed) into website `packages/`; commit + push website + PM
6. **Verify:** fresh clone of the git URL resolves the package (`package.json` at root)
7. **Remove from monorepo** — folder + `packages-lock.json` + `link.xml` + `BasisDocGenerator.cs`; if localized, defer to the Unity batch. Commit + push.

## Session 2026-07-07 — vendored NuGet deps → git, cleanup, setup package

**org.basisvr.* NuGet-wrapper libs → individual BasisVR git repos (disposition: keep).** These were the
last `file:` local mounts — repackaged NuGet DLLs. Now resolved from git instead of vendored tarballs.
Built GUID-preserving from the embedded folders (DLL bytes + `.meta` GUIDs byte-identical to what Unity
resolved, so framework references are unchanged), each with README + `.gitattributes` (`*.dll binary`).
They are `keep` framework infrastructure, **not** user-installable features → **intentionally NOT listed**
on basisvr.org/packages or in the BasisPM catalog.

| pkg id | repo | ver |
|---|---|---|
| org.basisvr.base128 | [BasisBase128](https://github.com/BasisVR/BasisBase128) | 1.2.2 |
| org.basisvr.bouncycastle | [BasisBouncyCastle](https://github.com/BasisVR/BasisBouncyCastle) | 2.5.0 |
| org.basisvr.generator.equals | [BasisGeneratorEquals](https://github.com/BasisVR/BasisGeneratorEquals) | 3.2.0 |
| org.basisvr.k4os.compression.lz4 | [BasisK4osCompressionLZ4](https://github.com/BasisVR/BasisK4osCompressionLZ4) | 1.3.8 |
| org.basisvr.newtonsoft.json | [BasisNewtonsoftJson](https://github.com/BasisVR/BasisNewtonsoftJson) | 13.0.3 |
| org.basisvr.simplebase | [BasisSimpleBase](https://github.com/BasisVR/BasisSimpleBase) | 4.0.2 |

Manifest now points each at `https://github.com/BasisVR/<Repo>.git`; the 5 loose `.tgz` + 6 embedded
folders removed; `packages-lock.json` file:/embedded entries dropped (Unity regenerates git entries on
open). `k4os.compression.lz4` was an *implicit embedded* package (not previously in the manifest) — now an
explicit git dep. Commit: `Swap org.basisvr deps for BasisVR git dependencies`.

**com.basis.setup** committed (`Add com.basis.setup package`) — Assets-config generators; static-verified,
**not yet Unity-compiled**.

**Only remaining `file:` mount:** `com.github.homuler.mediapipe`. Its manifest entry
(`file:com.github.homuler.mediapipe-0.16.3.tgz`) is **stale** — no such tarball exists; Unity resolves the
**embedded 389 MB folder** (968 files, native libs up to 47 MB). Safe cleanup available: drop the dead
manifest line (embedded folder auto-resolves). Converting the 389 MB native plugin to a git dep is
technically possible (all files < GitHub's 100 MB limit) but heavy and of dubious benefit vs staying
embedded like the other vendored native libs.

### mediapipe / shim / comms — the remaining knot (blocked on decisions, not code)

- **mediaplayer opt-in is blocked by shim.** `BasisShims.asmdef` hard-references `BasisMediaPlayer`
  (`VideoPlayerShim.cs` + `CilboxSceneBasis.cs` expose video playback to CILBOX sandbox worlds).
  mediaplayer is presently a `keep` git dep (shipped). To make it truly opt-in, gate the VideoPlayer shim
  behind a `versionDefine` (`#if BASIS_HAS_MEDIAPLAYER`) and drop the hard asmdef ref. **Decision:** keep
  mediaplayer shipped, or do the versionDefine refactor.
- **mediapipe extraction is blocked by two deps:** `com.github.homuler.mediapipe` (389 MB embedded, no git
  home) and `dev.hai-vr.basis.comms` (**Haï~-owned**; **circular** with shim — comms vpmDeps shim, shim
  vpmDeps comms). Policy: don't fork Haï~'s packages. **Decision:** coordinate with Haï~ to publish comms
  standalone (breaks the circular knot), or leave mediapipe embedded.
- **shim** stays embedded — it's the CILBOX sandbox bridge, hard-wired to framework + comms + cilbox +
  mediaplayer; not a clean leaf.
